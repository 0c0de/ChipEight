# ChipEight 
## Just another CHIP-8 EMULATOR
I started this project for a weekend that I was bored, I was interesting in emulation always and I thought that now it could be the time to start and go in

## What can do?
- [x] A file dialog window opens for select the game you want

- [x] Have sound

- [x] Have a well implemented input

- [x] Have a blueish palette of colors

- [x] Works quite well to be honest, no crashes after all
